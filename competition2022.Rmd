# <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Winners Announced!

Congratulations to all of the ten submissions! The team of international and national judges had a very difficult time determining a winner. The final decision was one winner and two equal runners-up. 

See the [ARDC Shaping Research Software interview with winners](https://ardc.edu.au/article/shaping-research-software-an-interview-with-lydia-lucchesi-and-sam-nelson/).

## Winner

- Vizumap package and VizumApp Shiny app
- Sam Nelson, Lydia Lucchesi, Petra Kuhnert 

The package provides functionality for visualising uncertainty in spatial data. There are four approaches: bivariate maps, map pixelation, glyph rotation and exceedance probability maps. These are original and innovative ideas solving a complex problem. The package is available at https://github.com/lydialucchesi/Vizumap and documented in the Journal of Open Source Software at https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02409. Users can access the shiny app at https://shiny.csiro.au/VizumApp/.

## Runners-up

- Matt Cowgill
- readabs R package

This package helps to download, import, and tidy data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics within R.  It provides a valuable resource for the Australian analytics community. More details on the package can be found at https://mattcowgill.github.io/readabs/.

- Martin Westgate, Dax Kellie, Matilda Stevenson, Peggy Newman
- galah R package

This package provides an interface to the data hosted by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and other living atlases, enabling users to locate and download species occurrence records (observations, specimens, eDNA records, etc.), taxonomic information, or associated media such as images or sounds, and to restrict their queries to particular taxa or locations. It provides a valuable service especially to the ecological community in Australia.
