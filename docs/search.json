Here’s Bill Venables talking about his\nexperiences, and why this award is important.\n Winners\nAnnounced!\nCongratulations to all of the ten submissions! The team of\ninternational and national judges had a very difficult time determining\na winner. The final decision was one winner and two equal\nrunners-up.\nThe winners will present their software in a public talk, on Thu Sep\n8, 1-2pm. Details are at the SSA events web\nsite, and you can directly register here.\nEntries for the 2023 award will open in early March 2023. Start\nplanning your submission now!\nWinner\nVizumap package and VizumApp Shiny app\nSam Nelson, Lydia Lucchesi, Petra Kuhnert\nThe package provides functionality for visualising uncertainty in\nspatial data. There are four approaches: bivariate maps, map pixelation,\nglyph rotation and exceedance probability maps. These are original and\ninnovative ideas solving a complex problem. The package is available at\nhttps://github.com/lydialucchesi/Vizumap and documented\nin the Journal of Open Source Software at https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02409. Users\ncan access the shiny app at https://shiny.csiro.au/VizumApp/.\nRunners-up\nMatt Cowgill\nreadabs R package\nThis package helps to download, import, and tidy data from the\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics within R. It provides a valuable\nresource for the Australian analytics community. More details on the\npackage can be found at https://mattcowgill.github.io/readabs/.\nMartin Westgate, Dax Kellie, Matilda Stevenson, Peggy Newman\ngalah R package\nThis package provides an interface to the data hosted by the Atlas of\nLiving Australia (ALA) and other living atlases, enabling users to\nlocate and download species occurrence records (observations, specimens,\neDNA records, etc.), taxonomic information, or associated media such as\nimages or sounds, and to restrict their queries to particular taxa or\nlocations. It provides a valuable service especially to the ecological\ncommunity in Australia.\n Call for\nSubmission\nDevelopers need to submit their work for consideration, along with a\nnomination from an SSA member.\nA brief description of the importance of the software to data\nscience or statistical practice and discuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of the new contribution compared to existing\nimplementations. Up to 400 words.\nAn installable software product (e.g. package or web app) with its\nsource code for use by the judging panel. It should be accompanied by\nenough information to allow the judges to effectively use and evaluate\nthe software (including its design considerations).\nSupporting letters from at least three users, indicating how they\nuse the software and benefits it has provided for their work.\nEligibility\nWe acknowledge our diverse developer community and especially\nencourage submissions from under-represented individuals and groups, and\nnew software developers from academia, industry or government.\nOpen to individual or a team developers based in Australia, who are\nrelatively new to software development.\nSoftware must be distributed with an open source license, as\ndescribed at https://opensource.org/licenses, actively developed and\nmaintained. It should be noted also, that this means that users would\nnot need to buy a license for any software in order to run the the\nsubmitted code.\nSoftware needs to have been developed primarily in Australia.\nThe submission member(s) do not need to be an SSA members, but it\ndoes need to be accompanied by a nomination from an SSA member. SSA\nmembers can nominate more than one candidate.\nThere is no specific programming language required.\nCriteria\nContribution makes a clear impact for the practice of data science\nor statistics.\nSoftware tackles an important problem, and has a clear purpose.\nEase of installation and use.\nCode is well-structured, and clearly documented in the code.\nDocumentation should also be publicly available, for example, via a\ndedicated web site containing instructions and example usage.\nDetails clarifying how to cite or otherwise acknowledge the software\nmust be available.\nSoftware supports and adheres to principles of reproducibility and\ninteroperability. That is, analyses performed can be readily shared and\nreproduced by others, and software systems.\nThe work must be:\nfunded or supported by Australian Funders or Institutions, or\nconducted by researchers residing in Australia, or affiliated with\nan Australian Institution while they wrote the software\n\nFirst release of the software is within the past three years.\nIndividual or (50% of) team is relatively new to software\ndevelopment, that is, this is the first or second statistical software\nproduct developed.\nJudges & Assessors\nThe award will be managed by the SSA SCV committee, who will recruit\na judging panel in any year.\nSubmit an Application\nTo submit, please complete this\nApplication form\n Important\nDates\n\nDate\nWhat\nApr 16, 2022\nOpening of submissions\nSat May 14 Fri May 20 2022\nClose of submissions\nJun 2022\nAnnouncement of the award winners\n\n Prize\nFirst prize will be $4000, with a runner-up prize of $1000. If the\njudges deem appropriate there may be equal first or runners-up,\nresulting in a division of the prize money.\n Bill Venables\n\nBill Venables pioneered the use of the S and consequently R languages in\nAustralia.
