      "contents": "\nThe goal of this award is to encourage new open source software development from the Australian community with a view to support efforts to develop and share data science and statistics methodology. Here’s Bill Venables talking about his experiences, and why this award is important.\n Winners Announced!\nCongratulations to all of the ten submissions! The team of international and national judges had a very difficult time determining a winner. The final decision was one winner and two equal runners-up.\nIn August 2022, the winners will present their software in a public talk. Watch the SSA events web site for the schedule.\nEntries for the 2023 award will open in early March 2023. Start planning your submission now!\nWinner\nVizumap package and VizumApp Shiny app\nSam Nelson, Lydia Lucchesi, Petra Kuhnert\nThe package provides functionality for visualising uncertainty in spatial data. There are four approaches: bivariate maps, map pixelation, glyph rotation and exceedance probability maps. These are original and innovative ideas solving a complex problem. The package is available at https://github.com/lydialucchesi/Vizumap and documented in the Journal of Open Source Software at https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02409. Users can access the shiny app at https://shiny.csiro.au/VizumApp/.\nRunners-up\nMatt Cowgill\nreadabs R package\nThis package helps to download, import, and tidy data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics within R. It provides a valuable resource for the Australian analytics community. More details on the package can be found at https://mattcowgill.github.io/readabs/.\nMartin Westgate, Dax Kellie, Matilda Stevenson, Peggy Newman\ngalah R package\nThis package provides an interface to the data hosted by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and other living atlases, enabling users to locate and download species occurrence records (observations, specimens, eDNA records, etc.), taxonomic information, or associated media such as images or sounds, and to restrict their queries to particular taxa or locations. It provides a valuable service especially to the ecological community in Australia.\n Call for Submission\nDevelopers need to submit their work for consideration, along with a nomination from an SSA member.\nA brief description of the importance of the software to data science or statistical practice and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the new contribution compared to existing implementations. Up to 400 words.\nAn installable software product (e.g. package or web app) with its source code for use by the judging panel. It should be accompanied by enough information to allow the judges to effectively use and evaluate the software (including its design considerations).\nSupporting letters from at least three users, indicating how they use the software and benefits it has provided for their work.\nEligibility\nWe acknowledge our diverse developer community and especially encourage submissions from under-represented individuals and groups, and new software developers from academia, industry or government.\nOpen to individual or a team developers based in Australia, who are relatively new to software development.\nSoftware must be distributed with an open source license, as described at https://opensource.org/licenses, actively developed and maintained. It should be noted also, that this means that users would not need to buy a license for any software in order to run the the submitted code.\nSoftware needs to have been developed primarily in Australia.\nThe submission member(s) do not need to be an SSA members, but it does need to be accompanied by a nomination from an SSA member. SSA members can nominate more than one candidate.\nThere is no specific programming language required.\nCriteria\nContribution makes a clear impact for the practice of data science or statistics.\nSoftware tackles an important problem, and has a clear purpose.\nEase of installation and use.\nCode is well-structured, and clearly documented in the code.\nDocumentation should also be publicly available, for example, via a dedicated web site containing instructions and example usage.\nDetails clarifying how to cite or otherwise acknowledge the software must be available.\nSoftware supports and adheres to principles of reproducibility and interoperability. That is, analyses performed can be readily shared and reproduced by others, and software systems.\nThe work must be:\nfunded or supported by Australian Funders or Institutions, or\nconducted by researchers residing in Australia, or affiliated with an Australian Institution while they wrote the software\n\nFirst release of the software is within the past three years.\nIndividual or (50% of) team is relatively new to software development, that is, this is the first or second statistical software product developed.\nJudges & Assessors\nThe award will be managed by the SSA SCV committee, who will recruit a judging panel in any year.\nSubmit an Application\nTo submit, please complete this Application form\n Important Dates\n\nDate\nWhat\nApr 16, 2022\nOpening of submissions\nSat May 14 Fri May 20 2022\nClose of submissions\nJun 2022\nAnnouncement of the award winners\n\n Prize\nFirst prize will be $4000, with a runner-up prize of $1000. If the judges deem appropriate there may be equal first or runners-up, resulting in a division of the prize money.\n Bill Venables\n Bill Venables pioneered the use of the S and consequently R languages in Australia.

The ARDC Research Software program is pursuing a vision of recognition of research software as a first-class output of research. The sponsorship of this award is in aid of recognising the valuable contribution made to research when new ideas, methods and models are captured in this uniquely actionable form of knowledge representation.\n\n\n\n",
