His book "Modern Applied Statistics with S" co-authored with Brian Ripley was the primary manner that many analysts learned their trade, across the globe. It is now in its fourth edition. For many people, Billâ€™s tutorials on data analysis with S and R was the first entry point to working with data. Throughout his many years in academia and with CSIRO, Bill has contributed to the analysis of data from many fields but primarily in ecology, environment, and climate change.
